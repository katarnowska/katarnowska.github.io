6278365,Josh stated that one of his biggest complaints about Altorfer Cat is the pricing structure they use for service charges. He stated that the cost of labor is way too high.  Josh also stated that he is not very impressed with the way the technicians approach a problem.  He stated that the technician’s first approach is to troubleshoot and that can get quite costly due to the time incurred then the next approach is process of elimination which is also very costly.  Josh stated that when he calls a Caterpillar trained technician out to work on Caterpillar equipment he expects them to be more knowledgeable of the equipment they are servicing.  He stated that he would not expect a John Deere technician to come out and know about his Caterpillar equipment but he certainly expects the Caterpillar technicians to be more prepared and not approach every repair as trial and error and charge such extreme repair charges.
5223319,"Ryan said every time he calls to get service work done he waits and waits on the line and then when he speaks with the service manager he is told that they'll be out to do the service within the next week and they don't show up so he has to call again. He said they have over 100 pieces of equipment in their fleet and he needs quick response-time. Ryan said the Springfield branch needs to respond to his calls, commit to a repair time and honor that commitment. Ryan asked for someone above the service manager in Springfield to call him. He said he's always had good service from the Champagne store but the service out of Springfield is very unsatisfactory."

He said fortunately he did not feel the pricing was out of line and he felt the repair was done correctly. However, he said he would like to see much better communication regarding the status of the repair on future repairs."

He said he took the unit in initially and it was misdiagnosed, which resulted in him paying for a lot of repairs he did not need. He said he took it in the second time and Empire did fix the problem, but he missed a lot of downtime at work and it affected his job. He said Empire was not willing to work with him at all on the first bill. He said at this time he would not return and he is ""telling people not to go to Empire"" rather than recommending them. He said he feels as a good faith gesture Empire should have refunded half of the initial bill for repairs that were not needed. Please call him if there is anything further that can be done on the bill."

Rick stated that the communication and understaffing is the biggest problem with Finning Canada right now. Rick stated that the general consensus in his industry with other loggers he encounters is that Finning Canada was the best of the best 5 years ago, another company couldn’t come close to competing with them; and now Finning Canada is one of lesser companies he deals with due to the decline in excellent service over the last 5 years."

He stated that the technician still changed the alternator twice (it was a new one). He also had to rent a trailer to take his machine to & from the shop, but he feels he was given the ""run around"" as to when to pick up his machine. End result, Mr.Beazy stated that he had to pay for 3 days of labor, 2 new alternators and a new battery. He also stated that the computers were down that day and he could not get an invoice - He stated that he had to sign a blank paper with an amount. He stated that he will not be returning to Finning. He would not recommend them either.  Please have someone contact Mr.Beazer."

He brought his machinery to that location because they had the equipment to change the tracks and they have a night crew to do it and have it ready for the next morning.    Ryan was told it would approximately take half a day, but it took 1 ? day instead.  He said that he is disappointed with the timeliness of the service (twice the time) and the invoice amount (was charged for almost triple the labor even though he had been told that for this kind of job, they do not charge labor after 8 hours). He said that reaching the Mildred location is not easy, he feels like he is passed around and cannot get a direct line which made it difficult when he was not kept informed on the status of the service and waiting for the invoice (for up to 5 weeks).

Fred decided to go ahead with tear down and inspection and was charged another $1100. Fred stated that he is very unhappy because he believes the staff knew it was a flogged motor due to research and internal research CAT had done. Eventually the motor was replaced but Fred stated that it took intervention of Caterpillar headquarters in Peoria to approve it. Fred stated that knowing that he was sold faulty equipment and then parts for a known problem makes him feel taken advantage of.

6253329,"Mr. Durkin has been extremely upset with the service that he has received. He stated that HOLT CAT is very unhelpful, and they will not return calls, and they give him the run around. He is not happy because when he calls for service, he would like for the same person that comes out to be able to take care of any and all problems, and he should not have to call another technician to do another portion of the job. But if this has to happen according to HOLT CAT'S job specific classification than Mr. Durkin feels that the burden of calling another technician out should rest on the shoulders of HOLT CAT and not his.
Mr. Durkin does not want to be the one that has to called 3/4 different technicians out to service the same piece of equipment.
Mr. Durkin stated that if he can avoid it, he will not use HOLT CAT because of them giving him the run-around. He has started purchasing John Deere and New Holland equipment because their service levels are better than HOLT CAT."

Additionally, the repair was subbed out t Atlas Machine, which Mr. Goad expressed that he could have taken it to another dealer, but he wanted a CAT dealer.
